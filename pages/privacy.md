## 1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

### Personal information you disclose to us

_**In Short:** We collect personal information that you provide to us._

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information
about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the App or otherwise when you contact us.

The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the App, the choices
you make and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:

All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete and accurate, and you must notify us of any
changes to such personal information.

### Information automatically collected

_**In Short:** Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics
— is collected automatically when you visit our App._

We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the App. This information does not reveal
your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as
your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device
name, country, location, information about how and when you use our App and other technical information. This
information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, and for our internal analytics and
reporting purposes.

The information we collect includes:

* _Log and Usage Data._ Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage and performance information our servers
  automatically collect when you access or use our App and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact
  with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type and settings and information
  about your activity in the App (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed,
  searches and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system
  activity, error reports (sometimes called ‘crash dumps') and hardware settings).

## 2. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?

_**In Short:** We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to
protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations_

We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:

* **Consent:** We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information for a
  specific purpose.
* **Legitimate Interests:** We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business
  interests.
* **Performance of a Contract:** Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal
  information to fulfill the terms of our contract.
* **Legal Obligations:** We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with
  applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a
  court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement
  requirements).
* **Vital Interests:** We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or
  take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to
  the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.

More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations:

* **Business Transfers.** We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any
  merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
* **Offer Wall.** Our App may display a third-party hosted "offer wall." Such an offer wall allows third-party
  advertisers to offer virtual currency, gifts, or other items to users in return for the acceptance and completion of
  an advertisement offer. Such an offer wall may appear in our App and be displayed to you based on certain data, such
  as your geographic area or demographic information. When you click on an offer wall, you will be brought to an
  external website belonging to other persons and will leave our App. A unique identifier, such as your user ID, will be
  shared with the offer wall provider in order to prevent fraud and properly credit your account with the relevant
  reward. Please note that we do not control third-party websites and have no responsibility in relation to the content
  of such websites. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website does not imply an endorsement by us of such
  website. Accordingly, we do not make any warranty regarding such third-party websites and we will not be liable for
  any loss or damage caused by the use of such websites. In addition, when you access any third-party website, please
  understand that your rights while accessing and using those websites will be governed by the privacy notice and terms
  of service relating to the use of those websites

## 3. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?

_**In Short:** We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third-party providers who
advertise, but are not affiliated with, our Application._

The App may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other
websites, online services or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any
third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the
content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services or
applications that may be linked to or from the App. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact
them directly to respond to your questions.

## 4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

_**In Short:** We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice
unless otherwise required by law._

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy
notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal
requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 1 year.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored
in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing
until deletion is possible.

## 5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

_**In Short:** We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security
measures._

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic
transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect
your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only
access the App within a secure environment.

## 6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?

_**In Short:** We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age._

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the App, you represent that
you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of
the App. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will
deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware
of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please [contact us][1].

## 7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

_**In Short:** In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK), you have rights that
allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your
account at any time._

In some regions (like the EEA and UK), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include
the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or
erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In
certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make
such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance
with applicable data protection laws.

If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at
any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will
it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
consent.

If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also
have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details
here: https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.

If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available
here: https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.

## 8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or
setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

## 9. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?

_**In Short:** Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your
personal information._

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California
residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal
information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all
third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a
California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact
information provided below.

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the App, you have the right
to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the App. To request removal of such data, please contact
us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a
statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the App, but please be
aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g. backups, etc.).

#### How do we use and share your personal information?

More information about our data collection and sharing practices can be found in this privacy notice.

You may contact us by email with [this form][1].

If you are using an authorized agent to exercise your right to opt-out we may deny a request if the authorized agent
does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf.

#### Will your information be shared with anyone else?

We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to a written contract between us and each
service provider. Each service provider is a for-profit entity that processes the information on our behalf.

We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research for
technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to be "selling" of your personal data.

Aroxoft has not disclosed or sold any personal information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the

other consumers.

#### Your rights with respect to your personal data

##### Right to request deletion of the data - Request to delete

You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will
respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but
not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements
resulting from a legal obligation or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.

##### Right to be informed - Request to know

Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:

* whether we collect and use your personal information;
* the categories of personal information that we collect;
* the purposes for which the collected personal information is used;
* whether we sell your personal information to third parties;
* the categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose;

  we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is de-identified in response to a consumer request
  or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request.

##### Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights

We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.

##### Verification process

Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we
have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we
can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you
submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the
information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you
have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.

We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If,
however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We
will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

##### Other privacy rights

* you may object to the processing of your personal data.
* you may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the
  processing of the data.
* you can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an
  authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance
  with the CCPA.
* you may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving a request
  to opt-out, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than 15 days from the date of the
  request submission. To exercise these rights, you can contact us by email with [this form][1]. If you have a
  complaint about how we handle your data, we would like to hear from you.

information.
